# **Introduction**

Welcome to the Taiv Web UI toolkit! ðŸ‘‹

This toolkit is designed to make frontend work quicker, easier, and better for developers working on Taiv's web apps. That currently includes:

- Taiv Web App
- Taiv Ad Manager

With support soon to come for:

- Taiv Utility Dashboard

The main goals of this UI toolkit are to:

- Consolidate Taiv's visual language into a single source of truth
- Provide an easy reference for designers and developers as to what components currently exist
- Reduce code duplication by finding common design patterns and implementing them in a more efficient way
- Reduce the amount of decisions needed for front-end work by providing easy to use variants, sizes, etc. for common use cases

This toolkit is a **work in progress**. As new mocks are designed and new pages are released, some components may need to be tweaked.
