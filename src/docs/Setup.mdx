# Setup With Your Project

To get started with the toolkit in a new repo, the npm package for the toolkit needs to be installed and setup. Ensure you have the following installed in your project:

- Node 20
- TypeScript 5
- React 17
- Tabler Icons

Then, you can install the package from npm:

```tsx
npm i @taiv/ui
```

Once installed, you should also make the following changes to your project.

1. Uninstall any @recharts and @mantine packages if they exist, as they are no longer needed.

2. Add the fonts and icon sheet to your `index.html` file:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.7.2/css/all.min.css"
  integrity="sha512-Evv84Mr4kqVGRNSgIGL/F/aIDqQb7xQ2vcrdIwxfjThSH8CSR7PBEakCr51Ck+w+/U6swU2Im1vVX0SVk9ABhg=="
  crossorigin="anonymous"
  referrerpolicy="no-referrer"
/>
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />
```

3. Add the modals and notifications providers to your `index.jsx` file, something like:

```tsx
<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <ModalProvider />
  <NotificationProvider />
  <BrowserRouter>
    <div>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/" component={Root} />
      </Switch>
    </div>
  </BrowserRouter>
</ThemeProvider>
```

Done! You should now be able to use the toolkit in your project.

The npm package is **public** and requires no access keys. It contains **strictly** UI components, constants, etc. so in order to test changes, you will need to npm link to your web project and run that. Continue to the next section to learn how to contribute to the toolkit.
