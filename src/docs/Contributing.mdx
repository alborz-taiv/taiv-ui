# How to Contribute

<br />

### Getting Started with UI Changes

To implement UI Toolkit changes, you will need to npm link to your web project so that any changes you make to the toolkit are reflected in your web project.

1. In the toolkit repo, start a new terminal and run `npm link`
2. In your project repo (i.e. web app), run `npm link @taiv/ui`
3. Done! Make any changes and test them in your project.

You can also use Storybook as a starting point for your development by running `npm run storybook` in the toolkit repo.

### Publishing UI Changes

1. If you created a new component, hook, etc, make sure you added it to the appropriate `index.ts`
2. Once you're satisfied, `npm run build` and commit your changes to the toolkit repo
3. If this is the first time you're contributing to the toolkit, run `npm login` to open a browser tab and log in. You can also doublecheck if you're logged into npm with `npm whoami`.
4. Version bump the package by running `npm version [patch | minor | major]` (depending on the type of version update)
5. In the toolkit repo, run `npm publish` to update npm
6. In your consuming project, run `npm i @taiv/ui` to get your new version of the package
7. Test again and make sure that the latest version of the package contains your changes and works as expected
8. Done! If you created a new component, update Storybook and write a documentation page for it if you have the time.
