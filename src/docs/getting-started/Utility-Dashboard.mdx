# **A Note About Utility Dashboard**

The Utility Dashboard currently has **limited support** in this toolkit. Due to the root font difference between the Web App/Ad Manager and the Utility Dashboard, some components may not be sized as expected.   

For now, please try sizing down on components where possible using the `size` prop. If that doesn't work, just use existing components/MUI until we can get a proper solution in place.
