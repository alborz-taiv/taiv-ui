# **Taiv Web UI Toolkit**

This toolkit is designed to make frontend work quicker, easier, and better for developers working on Taivâ€™s web apps.

To get started with the toolkit in a new repo, the npm package for the toolkit needs to be installed and setup.

## Installation

To get started with the toolkit, ensure you have the following installed in your project:

- Node 20
- TypeScript 5
- React 17

Then, you can install the package from npm:

```tsx
npm i @taiv/ui
```

The npm package is **public** and requires no access keys. It contains **strictly** UI components, constants, etc. so in order to test changes, you will need to npm link to your web project and run that.

See the Notion documentation for more information on usages and best practices.
